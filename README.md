Range Forge is a testing tool framework for breach and attack simulation. Range Forge, as the name implies, is like a workshop where tests are created.  It can be used in a cyber range or deployed in a production environment. Attack patterns are inspired from the MITRE ATT&CK repository and other well socialized and industry accepted sources.  It is a free tool for the community and vendor agnostic.
